Changes made:

- Removed two exact duplicate rows: Office chairs and Printer paper. Retained 18 expenses, including both Team lunch purchases on different dates.
- Standardized dates:
  - `03/04/2026` → `2026-03-04`
  - `March 5 2026` → `2026-03-05`
  - `3/9/26` → `2026-03-09`
  - `10/03/2026` → `2026-03-10`
  - `Mar 13` → `2026-03-13`
  - `18/03/2026` → `2026-03-18`
  - `3/24/2026` → `2026-03-24`
- Changed category capitalization for Printer paper and Pens to `Office Supplies`, Taxi to client to `Travel`, Figma seats to `Software`, and Desk lamp to `Furniture`.
- Removed all dollar signs and the thousands comma in `1,240.00`.
- Added decimal places for Printer paper (`48.50`), Zoom subscription (`149.00`), and Desk lamp (`64.00`).

Uncertainty: The source mixes date formats. Your instruction that every expense is from March 2026 resolves the ambiguous dates and supplies the missing year for `Mar 13`. Nothing remains unresolved.
